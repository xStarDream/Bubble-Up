This is the Project done for my Tesis "Approcches to AI for Videogames".

 This Project presents an AI for wolves made merging Finite State Machine and Behavioral Tree. 
Wolves are capable to cooperate togheter through a BlackBoard wich receve their intention and allow Action to them, resambling the behaviour of a pack of Wolves. 
Also is possible to Damage all Wolves using the RightClick of the mouse, which will activate the Rabit IA, an Goal-Orientend Artificial Inteligence with the mission to heal wolves ,giving prority by Distance and Status of Wolves.
